To run MulungShop, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python3

You can install the Python Firebase library with the following command:
pip install firebase_admin

Subsequently, you can debug the main.py file and headover to @MulungShopBot in the Telegram App or access the link here: t.me/MulungShopBot

If you type "/start" and the bot responds, the bot is working successfully.

If it does not respond, the internet connection might be lagging, or you can try debugging the main.py file again.

If you are running the bot for the first time, ensure that the script "dbCreation.ipynb" is executed with the products table populated or there might be an error returned.
There is no need to create the Firebase database since it is already deployed and live on the cloud. For access rights to the console, please email the team leader at:
